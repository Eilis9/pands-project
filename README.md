## Literature Review
Fisher's Iris Dataset [x] is a well known database dating from the 1930s when it was cited by the academic R.A. Fischer in the Annual Eugenics journal [XX]. R.A. Fisher was an English polymath who was active in the fields of mathematics, statistics, biology and genetics [xx]. The Iris dataset comprises 50 measurements each of three distinct classes of Iris flower found growing in the same meadow. The length and width of the sepal and petal for each flower along with the class is recorded [XXX].

The dataset is used as an example of.....

## Basic Analysis
The basic statistical measures of the data are given in Table X.
