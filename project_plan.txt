Project Plan (Eilis Donohue PANDS project):

1. Look at the literature about the dataset
	a. Lit review - about, origins, etc. Also the significance of it to DA? - Partially done

2. Do the minimum analysis
	a. Perform the minimum analysis min, max etc - DONE
	b. Tidy up the output to file with some .rjust() string formatting etc - DONE
	c. Do some basic plots - histograms, scatters, the plot matrix (seaborn) - almost DONE!
	
3. Further analysis
	a. Try to recreate the Fisher analysis, solving for alpha parameters? - Maybe not!
	b. Do some numpy stat analysis. Variance should prob be included in 1. - to do
	c. Look at some other papers for inspo? - to do
	d. Create some 3D plots? - prob not useful.
	e. Benfords Law check - not entirely relevant but would be interesting.
	f. Rolling mean - looking at percentiles to assess randomness of data collection?
	
4. Putting this in a jupyter notebook
	a. How do you hide code cells for nbconvert...
	b. Displaying tables side by side?
	c. Generally laying it out...
